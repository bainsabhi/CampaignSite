    "content": [
      "Trees are a vital part of Kitchener\u2019s urban landscape. They clean our air, provide shade, support mental  well-being and offer habitat for local wildlife. While the City of Kitchener actively maintains over 72,000 trees on public land, trees on private property also play a crucial role in growing and sustaining our urban tree canopy.",
      "To better understand how residents care for and manage trees on their own properties, the City is inviting community members to  participate in a new survey focused on Private Tree Conservation and Management.",
      "This survey is part of a broader effort to protect and expand Kitchener\u2019s tree canopy, which currently covers 27 per cent of the city. With goals of reaching 30 per cent coverage in every ward by 2050 and 33 per cent citywide by 2070, private trees are key to achieving long-term success.",
      "The survey asks residents to share their experiences with tree planting, maintenance, and removal on private property. It also seeks feedback on  residents\u2019 knowledge and experience with  the City\u2019s  current  Private Tree Bylaw, which requires a permit for the removal of trees on lots  one acre in size or greater . By gathering input from homeowners, renters, and property managers, the City hopes to improve  our bylaw and  policies, support responsible tree care and ensure that private trees continue to thrive.",
      "Whether  you\u2019ve planted a tree in your yard, had to remove one or simply enjoy the shade they provide, your voice matters. The survey takes just a few minutes to complete and will help shape future policies,  programs,  practices and bylaws that affect tree conservation across Kitchener.",
      "The survey can be found on the project\u2019s Engage Kitchener page  https://www.engagewr.ca/privatetrees ."

During a series of group and individual meetings,  he worked with his Federation of Canadian Municipalities BCMC colleagues to  advance  both Kitchener and  shared priorities \u2013 priorities across Canada around housing, infrastructure,  transportation,  trade diversification, and more.",
