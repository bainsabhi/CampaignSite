      "Ottawa, Ontario \u2013  Kitchener  Mayor Berry Vrbanovic  joined Canada\u2019s Big City Mayors\u2019 Caucus (BCMC)  in Ottawa  this week, where he met with Prime Minister Mark Carney and key federal ministers. During a series of group and individual meetings,  he worked with his Federation of Canadian Municipalities BCMC colleagues to  advance  both Kitchener and  shared priorities \u2013 priorities across Canada around housing, infrastructure,  transportation,  trade diversification, and more.",
      "Building on the momentum of these meetings, Mayor Vrbanovic emphasized the importance of predictable, long-term funding from all orders of government.",
      "\u201cCanada\u2019s big-city mayors are united in  our priorities as  we  look to  be  partners in prosperity with Ottawa to build strong cities and a strong, resilient Canada,\u201d said Mayor Vrbanovic. \u201cKitchener  and other cities like us  are ready to work hand in hand with  both  federal and provincial/territorial governments ,\u201d added Mayor Vrbanovic.  \u201cCanada\u2019s economic future runs through our cities, and we share Ottawa\u2019s ambition and sense of urgency to tackle these challenges together,  but we need  funding programs to be setup  in a manner that allows us all to succeed .\u201d",
      "BCMC mayors stressed the importance  to federal officials  of  expediting federal funding programs , particularly as housing remains a top national priority. Sustained federal investment is essential fo r cities to keep pace with rapid population growth,  rising  infrastructure demands, and  trade uncertainty.",
      "\u201cWe must work collaboratively, setting aside traditional mechanisms where necessary, to ensure budgeted dollars can flow quickly. By moving investments out the door faster, through FCM and other partners, cities can get projects underway, create jobs, and accelerate the construction of the infrastructure Canadians urgently need.\u201d",
      "The BCMC continues to advocate for solutions that strengthen Canadian cities, including  the urgent need for reliable, long-term  infrastructure  funding,  renewing key housing and homelessness programs, and  tackling emerging public safety issues in our  cities.  These measures are essential to ensuring cities can meet housing targets, support affordability, and  maintain  the services  and quality of life priorities  Canadians rely on every day.",
      "\u201c As municipal leaders  who are  responding  daily to the pressures of  our growing communities,  we\u2019re committed to doing our part,\u201d  said Mayor Vrbanovic. \u201cFrom o ur meeting with Prime Minister  Carney  to meetings with Ministers Francois-Philippe Champagne, Steven MacKinnon, Maninder Sidhu and others, I\u2019m optimistic about the collaboration  we are seeing as  we work together with Canada\u2019s new government , to strengthen housing, transit, and economic  growth  as part of Team Canada,  across the country from coast to coast to coast. \u201d",

Their contributions continue to influence our city today and will guide and inspire the  generations that follow.",
      "Black History Month is also a time to reflect  and be honest about the work  that  still needs to be done. It calls on all of us to recommit  to building a city where equity, belonging, and human rights are not just ideals, but everyday practices. That includes acknowledging and confronting anti\u2011Black racism, both its historical roots and the ways it continues to show up in our systems, institutions, and daily lives. A true sense of belonging means that people feel seen, valued, and safe, not only during moments of recognition, but in ordinary,  everyday spaces of life . It means creating a community where Black residents can thrive, contribute, and be their whole, authentic  selves without barriers.",
      "I encourage everyone to use this month as an opportunity to learn more about Black Canadian history and reflect on the challenges and accomplishments of Black Canadians. I invite you to learn,  participate, and celebrate.  Whether through  local  community events, storytelling, food, music, or reflection, there are so many different ways to engage.",
