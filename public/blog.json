      "As we begin 2026, I know that affordability remains the top concern for families across Kitchener. It is my responsibility as your Councillor to ensure the city respects your hard work by doing my part to manage our resources with absolute discipline. I am proud to share that Council has finalized a budget for 2026 that holds the property tax increase to just 2.2%. This is below Ontario’s 2.4% average rate of inflation and stands as the lowest property tax increase in the entire Waterloo Region, representing an impact of approximately $29 for the average household for the entire year. For full budget info visit www.kitchener.ca/budget.",
      "This result came from making difficult, fiscally responsible choices, without compromising on the services you have indicated are important to you. We achieved this rate by implementing a pause on hiring new staff, finding efficiencies within our existing teams, and ensuring that operating costs for major projects, like the new net-zero Cowan Recreation Centre, are balanced without placing an undue burden on the tax base. By avoiding costly last-minute spending amendments, we have delivered a budget that maintains the essential services we rely on while prioritizing your financial well-being.",
      "I wish you and your family a prosperous New Year. Please join me at my next drop-in resident meeting at the Country Hills Community Centre on Wednesday, January 21 from 7-8pm. I look forward to meeting you and hearing about your ideas, concerns, and questions."
